1. The Divide Step in the Quicksort partitions the arrays. 
2. Conquer recursively goes into sub-arrays and does #1.
3. No Combine Step necessary. 

Complexity Analysis: 
Quick sort's worst case time complexity is still O(n^2), but average case is O(n logn) because it's difficult to get a bad pivot every single time.
This happens if the pivot is consistently chosen so that all (or too many of) the elements in the array are < the pivot or > than the pivot.

 
- The Conquer stage can be parallelized. 
- Randomized Quick Sort is usually a good pivot. 
- Median-of-medians Algorithm can be used to find a good pivot for quicksort, but it may be slow
